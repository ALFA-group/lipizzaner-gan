# Lipizzaner
Lipizzaner is a framework to train generative adversarial networks with gradient-based optimizers like Adam in a coevolutionary setup. It hence combines the advantages of both to achieve fast and stable results, as described in our papers:

### Dev environment setup

##### Conda
```
conda env create -f ./src/helper_files/environment.yml
source activate lipizzaner
```

##### Pip
```
pip install -r ./src/helper_files/requirements.txt
```

### Quick start

Lipizzaner includes a quick start example to test the installation. In this experiment Lipizzaner trains a GAN by using four clients during 5 generations. The configuration files are located in `./src/configuration/quickstart/`. 

It is needed to set up some configuration parameters in `general.yml` to run the quick start experiment:
1. Set the clients IP addresses
2. Set the Losswise API key

To run the quickstart experiments the four clients should be started (e.g. by runing the above commands):
    ```
    python main.py train --distributed --client &
    python main.py train --distributed --client &
    python main.py train --distributed --client &
    python main.py train --distributed --client &
    ```

To start the master command line parameters are:
    ```
    python main.py train --distributed --master -f configuration/quickstart/mnist.yml`
    ```


### *Distributed* training
Lipizzaner currently supports two types of training: distributed (in a master/client setup, with `AsynchronousEATrainer`) and local (with all other `*Trainer` classes).

To run Lipizzaner in a distributed way, you have two different options:
- Starting the client nodes manually. This requires to specify the nodes' addresses and ports in `general.yml` (note that autodetect is not recommended in this scenario).
- Using Docker to orchestrate the clients. Each client will run in a separate container of a docker swarm.

##### Option 1: Manual

1. Set the clients IP addresses in `general.yml`:
   - Make sure to use a square number of clients (e.g. 4, 9, ...)
   - Ports will be assigned automatically, starting at 5000 on each machine
   - **Examples**:
     - If you are using one machine with four clients, the port range will be 5000-5003
     - If you are using two machines with 8 clients each, the port ranges will be 5000-5007 and 5000-5007 on the respective machines
2. Start the client as often on each machine as you specified in `general.yml`
   - Command line parameters are `python main.py train --distributed --client`
3. Start the master, e.g. on your local machine
   - Command line parameters are `python main.py train --distributed --master -f configuration/lipizzaner-gan/celeba.yml`

The master will then wait until the clients are finished, collect the results, and terminate itself. The clients remain running, waiting for new experiments.


##### Option 2: Docker Swarms
1. Setup docker on all machines you want to use
2. Create a docker swarm and an overlay network with the following commands:

    *Execute on orchestrator (or 'manager') node:*
    ```
    docker swarm init --advertise-addr <YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>
    docker network create -d overlay lpz-overlay
    ```

    *Execute on worker nodes (the exact command, including the token, is returned by first of the above commands):*
    ```
    docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER_IP_ADDRESS>:2377
    ```
    
3. **Optional:** Login to a Docker Hub account that has access to the private lipizzaner2018/lipizzaner repository (with `docker login`) on each machine.
4. If you don't want to use Docker Hub, you alternatively can clone the repo and build the container on each machine. 

    *To manually build the container, execute:* 
    ```
    docker build -t lipizzaner2018/lipizzaner .
    ```
5. Run the Lipizzaner clients.
 
    *Execute on the **manager** node:* 
    ```
    docker service create -e role=client --replicas <NR_OF_CLIENT> --network lpz-overlay --with-registry-auth --name lpz lipizzaner2018/lipizzaner:latest
    ```
    
    Docker will automatically distribute the clients over the all nodes in your swarm. 
   
6. Run the Lipizzaner master to start the experiments. 

    - **Make sure that autodiscover is set to `True` in `general.yml`, as this is required when running in docker.**

    - *Execute on any node:* 
        ```
        docker run -it --rm -e config_file=CONFIG_FILE -e SWARM=True -e role=master --network lpz-overlay --name lipizzaner-master lipizzaner2018/lipizzaner:lates
        ```
        
        Set the config file path as you would for a non-docker run, e.g. `configuration/lipizzaner-gan/celeba.yml`.
        Lipizzaner wil automatically detect and use all non-busy nodes in the Docker overlay network.
 
7. When the experiment has finished, you can stop the client service (or keep it running for future experiments):
    ```
    docker service rm lpz
    ```


###### GPU support
GPU support for Docker Swarms is currently limited:
1. **[GPUs currently can't be shared](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/141#issuecomment-366911268) across multiple swarm services**
2. [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) has to be installed on each machine
3. The docker daemon on each machine has to be [manually configured](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/issues/141#issuecomment-356458450) to use the GPU


##### Option 3: Docker with GPU support
The most simple workaround for the limitations stated above (especially the first one) is to manually run the docker containers manually (not as swarm services):

1. Use the command described in the first point of the section above to create a swarm and an overlay network. 
This is needed to establish communication between containers on multiple machines.

2. Login to Docker Hub (or manually build the image), also described above.

5. Run the Lipizzaner clients.
 
    *Execute the following command multiple times on each machine, e.g. 5 times each on 5 machines for 25 Lipizzaner clients:*
    
    ```
    docker run -d --rm -e role=client --runtime=nvidia --network lpz-overlay lipizzaner2018/lipizzaner:latest
    ```

6. Run the Lipizzaner master to start the experiments. 

    - **Again, make sure that autodiscover is set to `True` in `general.yml`, as this is required when running in docker.**

    - *Execute on any node (notice that this command differs from the one in the previous section - '-e SWARM=True' was removed):* 
        ```
        docker run -it --rm -e config_file=CONFIG_FILE -e role=master --network lpz-overlay --name lipizzaner-master lipizzaner2018/lipizzaner:lates
        ```
        
        Set the config file path as you would for a non-docker run, e.g. `configuration/lipizzaner-gan/celeba.yml`.
        Lipizzaner wil automatically detect and use all non-busy nodes in the Docker overlay network.

Some local implementations are parallelized, others are not (as the focus was on the distributed setup).

### Generating samples from a mixture
After a distributed training session finished, the results will be gathered on the master node (saved to `<output>/<trainer>/master`).
These results contain both sample data and the resulting neural network models in PyTorch's .pkl format.

To generate sample data from such a mixture, use the following command:

```
python main.py generate --mixture-source <SOURCE_DIR> -o <TARGET_DIR> --sample-size 100 -f <CONFIG_FILE>
```

Make sure that `<SOURCE_DIR>` points to a directory that contains both the .pkl files and the mixture.yml configuration file (created by Lipizzaner after training). Use the same `<CONFIG_FILE>` as for the training process. A concrete example could look like this:

 
```
python main.py generate --mixture-source ./output/lipizzaner_gan/master/2018-06-04_10-01-50/128.30.103.19-5000 -o ./output/samples --sample-size 100 -f configuration/lipizzaner-gan/celeba.yml
```
