- heuristic_loss: Loss function introduced in **Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks** 

C. Wang, C. Xu, X. Yao and D. Tao, "Evolutionary Generative Adversarial Networks," in IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation.


- mustang_loss: Loss function randomly picked from three different ones (BCE, MSE, and heuristic losses). It is introduced in **Spatial evolutionary generative adversarial networks**
