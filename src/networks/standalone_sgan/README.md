# Standalone Semisupervised GANs

We have included two examples of **SGANs* for comparison purposes.

It includes two different experiments:

- SGAN based on **MLPs** to address **MNIST**: from `src` directory run `python -W ignore networks/standalone_sgan/sgan.py`
- SGAN based on **CNNs** to address **CIFAR-10**: from `src` directory run `python -W ignore networks/standalone_sgan/sgan_convolutional.py`

Use --help flag to see the different configruation parameters.
