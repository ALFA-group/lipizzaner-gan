When an experiment is completed, this file can be used to obtain all the plots
corresponding to that experiment. To achieve this, all values like
f(Generator(x))=..., f(Discriminator(x))=... and score=... in the log file
corresponding to a client are copied to a dedicated file such as generator.txt,
discriminator.txt and fid.txt respectively (as indicated in the code below)
